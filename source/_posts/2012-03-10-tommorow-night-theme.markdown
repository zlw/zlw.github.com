There is great theme called Tommorow Night. It's brought for many text editors and IDEs. I use it in RubyMine.
Unfortunatelly it's not really up-to-date. HAML, SASS or CoffeeScript support is broken. That's why I created modified version.

You can download it and install like this: {% gist 2011640 %}

## Some examples

### HAML

### CoffeeScript

### SASS

I need to check how this color scheme looks like with Python and Django and make some changes if needed.
