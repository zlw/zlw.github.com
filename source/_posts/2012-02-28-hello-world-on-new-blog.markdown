## Hello World!

This is my.. (counting) .. 4th or 5th weblog. I tried wordpress, blogger, tumblr and many others.
But as every hacker knows, writing in markdown is much better than shitty WYSIWYG editors.

Plus, you know, having blog on **GitHub Pages(!)**, with **Octopress(!)**, written on a **MacBook Pro(!)** ?! .. WOOOW!
That is so hipster that I could not resist!

## What it is going to be about

You know, hacker stuff :)

Mostly **Ruby** and **Ruby on Rails** and stuff *around* - gems, testing etc.

But of course not always. Sometime maybe I'll write about **JavaScript** (I'm still trying to learn Ember.js and Backbone.js),
**Apple/Mac** (*"wow, look at this great app!"* etc.), **Python** and **Django** (I've been really into it about year ago).

I am still thinkig about my previous blog - should I move posts here from there? Has not yet decided.
Meantime, if you want to read it: [KrzysztofZalewski::Blog@Blogspot](http://kzalewski.blogspot.com/). Oh, yes, it is in Polish.

So, see you next time!
