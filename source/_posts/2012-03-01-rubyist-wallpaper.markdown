It's another post from *"[Wallpaper](http://localhost:4000/blog/categories/wallpaper/)"* series. This time, there is wallpaper especially for
Rubyist (if someone does not know, this is common expression for Ruby programmer).

## Wallpaper

I'm thinking about whole series with different programming languages logos -
Scala, Clojure, Erlang, Haskell, Python etc. (yes, that's **the list** of languages I like and/or want to learn)
