I came from Linux to Mac about 4-5 months ago. As you might know, in Linux you can change almost everything.
Apple don't go that way with Macs. You take it *"as is"* and everything you can **easily** change in GUI is wallpaper.
Oh, okay, you can move Dock to the left or right side of the screen ;)

That's why I am crazy about wallpapers, just like I was about changing GUI on Linux.
So, you can like it or not, I will post some awesome wallpaper from time to time.
